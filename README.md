## Connect 4 with AI (Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning)
A Python implementation of the classic Connect 4 game with a simple AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning.
The game uses Pygame for the GUI and lets the player compete against an AI that makes smart decisions (and sometimes random ones to feel more human ).
